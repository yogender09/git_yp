1. INTRODUCTION

This document describes the functional details of Non Stop Routing (NSR) 
support for scenarios with IGMP-only-interfaces.

A brief description on need for IGMP-only-interfaces can be found 
on RLI page 7235.  The functional specification written for the RLI 7235, 
will provide more insight into the feature.

All the IGMP-only-interfaces on a router are collectively represented 
in PIM as a pseudo-interface (xif). This way, in a scaled scenario 
where there are a lot of downstream interfaces which have only IGMP hosts, 
we need not run PIM on each of the interfaces.  

As of today, PIM NSR is supported only on interfaces that have PIM 
configured (pif). IGMP module does not run on the backup. So, the backup 
has no way of knowing about the IGMP reports received on IGMP-only-interfaces. 

When IGMP reports arrive on an IGMP-only enabled interface, PIM joins 
are created on the master with downstream as xif. Since the mirroring 
code does not understand xif, these joins are not mirrored to the backup. 
The multicast routes for these joins are created on master and 
synced to backup via ksyncd. Since, there is no matching PIM join 
on the backup RE, these multicast routes are marked as discard (Pruned).  

At this point, if a switchover occurs, the backup rpd has to wait for 
IGMP module to come up and then receive reports. After this, new PIM joins
are created and multicast routes are installed for forwarding.  
Until such time, there is a blackholing of traffic on the new master. 
This is undesirable in customer scenarios where there a lot of IGMP hosts 
on the downstream that expect seamless failover. 

This RLI addresses the above problem such that after failover, there 
is no traffic loss on the new RE. This is accomplished by mirroring the
IGMP/MLD-only interface JOIN state in PIM to the backup RE.

2. FUNCTIONALITY


Prior to this RLI effort, for IGMP-only enabled interfaces, PIM joins will
be created on the master but not on the backup (IGMP module does not run on 
the backup). On traffic flow, multicast route will installed with 'forwarding' 
flag on master. On backup, the multicast route will be received via ksyncd 
and will be installed with Discard flag on backup, since there is no 
matching PIM join on backup.  

A switchover at this point will cause the new master to wait for IGMP module
to come up and process the incoming IGMP reports from IGMP-only-enabled 
interfaces. This will inturn create PIM joins and install multicast routes.
This can take sometime depending on the load on the system. Until the time,
the joins and multicast routes are installed, there will be traffic loss
on the downstream hosts which is undesirable. 

With this RLI, IGMP will still not run on the backup. 

There is no need to run IGMP on the backup. The rationale is explained in the  
IGMP NSR functional spec below. 

http://cvs.juniper.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/sw-projects/os/nsr/igmp-nsr-funcspec.txt?view=markup

Mechanism used to replicate state: 
Since IGMP does not run on backup, we don't create any mirroring state
information in master IGMP. On master RE, the joins coming on the 
IGMP-only interfaces result in corresponding PIM states. These PIM 
states are mirrored using PIM NSR mirroring mechanism. This way, the
backup RE will have the needed PIM states on backup for IGMP-only 
enabled interfaces. The multicast routes on backup will find the 
matching PIM states and hence, will keep their state as forwarding.  
   
On switchover, on new master, since the multicast routes are in 'forwarding' 
state, the traffic continues to flow. The IGMP module starts on the new master
and refreshes the IGMP reports to PIM. So, there is no traffic loss during 
failover.  

This mechanism of mirroring PIM joins for IGMP only enabled interfaces holds
good for IGMPv2, IGMPv3, MLDv1 and MLDv2 reports/leaves. 

Initial State Synchronization (ISS): 
In the case when master RE is having all the multicast flows, we enable
NSR later or, if the backup RE comes up later, or if rpd on backup RE crashes
and is coming up again or 'restart routing' is performed on the backup RE. 
    IGMP and PIM interaction is implemented in such a way that once a IGMP 
report is received and PIM is notified, subsequent refreshes of IGMP reports
are not passed on to PIM. When backup rpd comes up later, the master should
be able to replicate all the PIM states for IGMP-only interfaces to the backup. 



2.1 GOALS

(i) The PIM Join states corresponding to IGMP-only interfaces will be mirrored to 
    backup for IGMP (version 2 and 3) and MLD (version 1 and 2) functionality.

(ii) PIM Joins on the backup will be same as PIM Joins on master for
    IGMP only enabled interfaces. 
 
(iii) Multicast routes on backup will be same as Multicast routes on master
    for IGMP-only-enabled interfaces.

(iv) After RE switchover, the routes will not be updated and there will 
    be minimal traffic loss for the multicast flows. 

(v) To clear joins on IGMP-only interfaces, clear igmp membership is to 
      be used on the master. Running this command on master should
      clear the PIM joins on the backup too. 

(vi) Since IGMP module is not running on the backup, all the IGMP related
      commands cannot be run on the backup. Commands run on the master
      should accordingly trigger state change on the backup for 
      IGMP-only-enabled interfaces. 

(vii) If NSR is enabled under set routing-options and PIM NSR is disabled using
      set protocols pim nonstop-routing disable, NSR for IGMP-only enabled
      interfaces will be deactivated. 

(viii) NSR should work well for Joins which have regular PIM interfaces as 
       well as IGMP-only interfaces on downstream.  

(ix)   PIM NSR support for Rosen MVPN is available from 12.2. A router having
       IGMP-only-enabled interfaces in downstream and having Rosen MVPN 
       configured in the upstream should be supporting NSR functionality. 

(x)    When upstream interface information (RPF) is changed, the SGs on the backup
       with downstream Pseudo-GMP interfaces should also be updated with the
       change in the upstream information. This applies for scenarios with and without
       PIM Join-load-balance enabled. 

(xi)    When downstream interface with Pseudo-GMP goes down, the SG entries on the master 
       get removed. This should be mirrored to the backup and the backup should also have
       the SG entries removed for that downstream.  

(xii)  IGMP/MLD reports received on dynamic-interfaces 

           IGMP/MLD reports received on dynamic interfaces are treated the same way
       as reports received on regular interface. The dynamic interfaces
       are replicated to the backup with ksyncd. The reports recieved on
       dynamic interfaces will be mirrored to the backup. On failover, the 
       interfaces should be retained and kept up on the new master (GRES support).  
           The PIM Joins and multicast routes should be retained on the new master
       after failover and there should not routes deletion/addition. Also, there
       should be no (or minimal) traffic loss similar to IGMP reports received
       on regular interfaces

           Dynamic interfaces can be configured in two ways: 
          (a) For statically configured dynamic interfaces (by operational commands)
                 cli>dynamic-configuration session create
                 cli>dynamic-configuration profile <profile-name> create client session-id 1

                 cli>dynamic-configuration profile <profile-name> delete client session-id 1
                 cli>dynamic-configuration session delete session-id 1

               In this case, the interfaces are not retained after failover. ie.,
               GRES support is not available for statically configured dynamic interfaces.
               We need to run the CLI command to enable dynamic interfaces again
               on the new master to bring up the dynamic interfaces. So, the multicast
               routes will be deleted and recreated in this case and there will be traffic
               loss.

          (b) For real dynamic interfaces (by virtue of dhcp/pppoe clients).  
               In this case, after failover, the dynamic interfaces remain up. So, 
               the behavior is same as IGMP reports received on normal interfaces. ie., 
               there will be no (or minimal) traffic loss for the multicast groups.

(xiii)  BIDIR 

       BIDIR is supported for Pseudo-gmp interfaces. Also, BIDIR supports NSR. 
       So, BIDIR NSR should be supported for Pseudo-gmp interfaces. Need to check
       feasibility whether any specific code changes for BIDIR NSR are needed.

2.2 NON-GOALS

(i) IGMP module will not run on the backup. IGMP reports will not be mirrored
     using socket replication. Socket replication for IGMP will be sub-optimal
     because each of the periodic IGMP packets have to be mirrored. Also, if hosts
     send reports with less interval, it can overload the system. On the contrary, 
     mirroring the IGMP/MLD-only-interface JOIN state in PIM to backup mirrors 
     only the first report/leave.  

(ii) After switchover, the traffic loss will be similar to the loss seen
     with PIM enabled interfaces. This is usually less an <1%. This RLI does
     not propose to have a 100% hitless failover.  

(iii) IGMP-only enabled interfaces are supported for only PIM Sparse mode. 
      (IGMP-only enabled interfaces are not supported for Dense mode) This
      RLI will support for NSR for IGMP-only enabled interfaces only for PIM 
      Sparse mode. 

(iv)  As of today (12.3), PIM NSR is not supported for Logical systems. So, this
      feature, PIM NSR for IGMP-only-enabled interfaces, will not have
      support for Logical systems. The above holds good for virtual router too.

(v)   As of today (12.3), NSR support for Next-gen MVPN is not available. A router
      with IGMP-only-enabled interfaces on downstream and having NGMVPN configured
      on the upstream will not have capability to support NSR functionality. 


(vi)  AMT: (Automatic Multicast Tunnelling) 
          AMT uses a type of dynamic tunnel interface which receives IGMP-only 
      reports.  AMT supports GRES. ie., the AMT interfaces are replicated to 
      the backup RE and are retained across failovers. But, AMT NSR is not supported. 
      ie., the AMT task does not run on the backup. So, after failover, the tunnels 
      will have to be recreated/refreshed. With this RLI, the Joins and mroutes 
      will be mmirrored but, since the AMT task has to be started on the new master 
      and the tunnels refreshed, we cannot claim NSR support for AMT interfaces. 
      When AMT NSR is implemented later, the availbility of PIM NSR for Pseudo-GMP 
      will help in ensuring no (or minimal) traffic loss across failovers.

(vii)  Immediate Deletion of Stale IGMP/MLD entries after failover 
          Please refer to the CAVEAT section for details about this corner case.

With the RLI changes, the join output on backup will be the same 
as master (except timers). The multicast route on backup will
have state as 'forwarding'. The statistics output on master
will be different from that in the master.

3. CAVEATS


(i) Timing out of Stale IGMP/MLD entries after failover 

       Scenario: Lets say there is a IGMP/MLD host sending reports for a group. 
   The PIM Join for the pseudo-gmp interface and the multicast route are
   mirrored/synced to the backup with this RLI. At the time of failover, 
   lets say the host interface shuts or the host sends a leave but the leave
   message is lost due to new RE taking sometime before getting ready.

   This is a corner case. 

   Because of the above, the new RE will have the mirrored SG state and
   multicast route after failover. The traffic, if any, will also be 
   forwarded on the downstream interfaces even if there are no downstream
   interested listeners.  This is because there is no way for the IGMP module 
   on the new master to know about this group so that it can time it out. 
   To mitigate this, after failover, a timer will be started in PIM reso 
   handling to purge all SG entries that are not refreshed by IGMP module. 
   This timer will typically be more than the IGMP hold time configured 
   on the interface (default 105). This is to allow enough time for the 
   SG entries to be refreshed by IGMP. 


(ii) Interfaces flapping on the backup RE

        In highly scaled scenarios, the backup RE can be subjected to 
   flapping of the IGMP-only interfaces due to issues in backup kernel 
   or ksyncd mirroring or dcd issues. The show pim join extensive output
   in the backup will not be able to show the interface if the interface
   on the backup is down. It will be represented as '???' similar to the
   scenario when an interface flaps on the master.     

         Also, if the interface is not up on the backup when the report
   is mirrored, the Joins will not be created on the backup. The RDBs 
   will be stored and a background resolve job will run that will check
   periodically for the interface coming up. Once the interface comes up
   the Join entry will be created. 


4. OTHER REQUIREMENTS

None.


5. PERFORMANCE

There is no performance degradation in NON_NSR case.

5.1 PERFORMANCE RELATED RESOURCES

There will be some extra usage of memory to store the RDBs on the
new master when NSR is enabled for this scenario. This is no different
than any module that has enabled NSR.

It is possible that there are 64K IGMP-only enabled interfaces 
in the downstream. Each of the IFL  on the downstream will have 
reports sent to one or two SGs.

Each of this PIM SG state with unique downstream IFL 
has to be mirrored to the backup. The structure to store the RDB will  
roughly contain atleast the below elements per entry (40 bytes).  

        Routing instance kernel id (4 bytes)
        Group address              (16 bytes to accomodate v6)
        Source address             (16 bytes to accomodate v6)
        IFL index                  (4 bytes)

   Each of the downstream IFL will result in 1 or 2 SGs. 

    2 * 65535 * 40 =  5120000 bytes = 5120K = 5M memory. 

  (Number of SGs per IFL * Number of IFLs * Size of 1 RDB)
